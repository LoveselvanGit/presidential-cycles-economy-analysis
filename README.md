Analyzing the Impact of U.S. Presidential Cycles on Economic and Stock Market Performance

This project explores the relationship between U.S. presidential cycles, GDP growth, and SPY ETF performance. It aims to validate the Presidential Election Cycle Theory, originally proposed by Yale Hirsch in the 1960s, and adapt it to modern market conditions using data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

Objective
Validate the Presidential Election Cycle Theory.
Analyze patterns in SPY ETF returns and GDP growth.
Forecast SPY prices for 2024 and 2025 using Facebook’s Prophet model.

Project Highlights
Investigates how political cycles influence market sentiment and economic fundamentals.
Utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends in SPY and GDP data.
Predicts future market performance using advanced time-series forecasting models.

Research Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize historical trends in SPY and GDP growth.
Identify cyclical patterns across presidential terms.
Theory Validation:
Compare SPY returns and GDP growth to the cycle theory.
Forecasting:
Use Facebook’s Prophet model to predict SPY prices for 2024-2025.
Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Key Insights
GDP Growth: Tends to be weakest in the 1st year of a term and strongest in the 2nd and 3rd years.
SPY Performance: Generally aligns with the theory, with strong returns in the 3rd and 4th years, though some deviations were observed.
Modern Adjustments: Time-to-market expectations and modern policies may necessitate revising the original theory to account for recent market trends.
